## Intstructions

### Setup

After opening the UI, you should see three panels: top left, bottom left, and right.

The top left panel is where you will specify the structures between which you wish to find polymorphisms. 


### SAT-solving



### Automated Theorem Proving

This functionality hasn't been scrutinised to the same extent as the SAT-solving approach since, in general, it did not perform quite as well. Nevertheless, one can use it as an alternative if SAT-solving is unable to obtain a result in a reasonable amount of time, or perhaps to verify any results that are obtained.


The locating of minion homomorphisms to projections feature is not available for this approach.
