The general format for specifying relational structures is as follows:

- The first line of the file should contain the domain, in the form of a list (e.g., [1,2,3,4]). 

- The subsequent lines of the file specify the relations. Each line should begin with a positive integer giving the arity of the relation, and following that should be tuples relating elements of the domain

See the example structures in this folder for more clarity.
Note that if the domain consists of letters rather than numbers, they should be of they should be written using speech marks (e.g., like ["a","b","c"] rather than [a,b,c]).
